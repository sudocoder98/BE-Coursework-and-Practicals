## Experiment 1
### To perform K-Means clustering on 1D and 2D data

1. k_means_1D.py
  - To allow user to input centroids comment lines 11-14 and uncomment lines 9-10  
    Input:  
    2 4 10 12 3 20 30 11 25  
    2 4  
  
  - To generate centroids comment lines 9-10 and uncomment lines 11-14  
    Input:  
    2 4 10 12 3 20 30 11 25  
    2  

2. k_means_2D.py
  - To allow user to input centroids comment lines 15-22 and uncomment lines 13-14  
    Input:  
    2 10 , 2 5 , 8 4 , 5 8 ,7 5 , 6 4 , 1 2 , 4 9  
    2 10 , 5 8 , 1 2  
  - To generate centroids comment lines 9-10 and uncomment lines 11-14  
    Input:  
    2 10 , 2 5 , 8 4 , 5 8 ,7 5 , 6 4 , 1 2 , 4 9  
    3  

**Note:** 
- Both files are currently set to generate random centroids for the specified number of clusters. 
- Generating random centroids may not always result in the same number of clusters as specified.

## Experiment 2
### To perform K-Nearest Neighbours on 2D data

Sample Input:
Enter the list of classifiers separated by spaces: Good Bad
Enter the data points and their classification: 7 7 Bad, 7 4 Bad, 3 4 Good, 1 4 Good
Enter the test coordinates: 3 7
Enter the size of the cluster: 3
