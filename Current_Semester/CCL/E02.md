# Experiment 02

## A study of Virtualisation and installation of KVM on Ubuntu

### Definition of Virtualisation
In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.

Virtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.

#### Terminology
 - Virtual Machine: A virtual representation of a physical machine.

 - Virtual Machine Monitor or Hypervisor: A software application that monitors and manages running virtual machines.

 - Host Machine: The physical machine that a virtual machine is running on.

 - Guest Machine: The virtual machine, running on the host machine.

### Types of Virtualisation

1. Hardware-accelet Virtualisation



 IaaS - Infrastructure as a service is taking the physical hardware and going completely virtual (e.g. all servers, networks, storage, and system management all existing in the cloud). This is the equivalent to infrastructure and hardware in the traditional (non-cloud computing) method running in the cloud. In other words, businesses pay a fee (monthly or annually) to run virtual servers, networks, storage from the cloud. This will mitigate the need for a data center, heating, cooling, and maintaining hardware at the local level.
Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure

2. Application Virtualisation SaaS - The software-as-a-service (SaaS) service-model involves the cloud provider installing and maintaining software in the cloud and users running the software from cloud over the Internet (or Intranet). The users' client machines require no installation of any application-specific software since cloud applications run in the cloud. SaaS is scalable, and system administrators may load the applications on several servers. In the past, each customer would purchase and load their own copy of the application to each of their own servers, but with the SaaS the customer can access the application without installing the software locally. SaaS typically involves a monthly or annual fee.
Examples: Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides)

3. Platform Virtualisation PaaS - Platform as a Service, as the name suggests, provides you computing platforms which typically includes operating system, programming language execution environment, database, web server etc.
* Examples: Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos.

4. NaaS - Networking as a Service (NaaS) is the sale of network services from third parties to customers that donâ€™t want to build their own networking infrastructure.
NaaS packages networking resources, services, and applications as a product that can be purchased for a number of users, usually for a contracted period of time. It can include services such as Wide Area Networking (WAN) connectivity, data-center connectivity, bandwidth on demand (BoD), security services, and other applications.
* Example: Virtual private network (VPN) - Extends a private network and the resources contained in the network across networks like the public Internet. It enables a host computer to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were a private network with the functionality and policies of the private network.


5. IDaaS - Identity as a service (IDaaS) comprises cloud-based solutions for identity and access management (IAM) functions, such as single sign-on (SSO). These methods allow all users (customers, employees, and third parties) to more securely access sensitive information both on and off-premises.
* Example: Two Factor Authentication (Google 2-Step Verification)

6. SECaaS - Security as a service (SECaaS) is an outsourced service wherein an outside company handles and manages your security. At its most basic, the simplest example of security as a service is using an anti-virus software over the Internet.
* Examples: Security Analysis, Email monitoring, Data loss prevention

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Virtualisation
#### Advantages
- Cost - Hardware and software maintenance cost is reduced using the cloud.  
- Performance - Fast processing of applications as cloud server's capacity of execution is very high.  
    A huge amount of storage capacity is provided by cloud.
- Better Resource Utilisation - The requirement for large number of powerful servers and IT staff to handle them goes down.
- Scalability - Scaling out a cloud service is easier to accomplish as the application itself is not tied down to the infrastructure.
- *Security* - The cloud computing vendors ensure highly secured password protected accounts.

#### Disadvantages
- Internet Requirement - Without an Internet connection cloud computing is impossible because, to access any application or document a constant internet connection is a must.
- Minimum Resource Requirement It also requires high speed internet connection because web based apps need a lot of bandwidth to download (large document).
- Locality - The actual location of user data is unknown and may be subject to different rules and laws than those applicable to the user themself.
- *Security* - Security of data on the cloud can be questionable. Since data management and infrastructure management in cloud is provided by third-party, it is always a risk to handover the sensitive information to cloud service providers.
- Insecure or Incomplete Data Deletion - It is possible that the data requested for deletion may not get deleted.
